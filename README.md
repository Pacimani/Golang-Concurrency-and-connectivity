This repository contains my learning journey in Go, covering core concepts and practical implementations. Below is a summary of each topic covered:

- **Syntax**: Basics of Go's syntax, including variable declarations, control structures, and error handling.
- **Data Structures**: Working with arrays, slices, maps, and structs to handle data effectively.
- **Concurrency**: Exploring goroutines and channels for concurrent processing and improved performance.
- **Connectivity**: Establishing network connections, working with HTTP and WebSocket protocols.
- **High Performance**: Optimizing code for speed and resource efficiency, with a focus on memory management.

Each folder includes code examples and exercises related to the topic. Happy coding!
